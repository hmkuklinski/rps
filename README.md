## The Inspiration for this Project
One of the Codedex projects in the Legend of Python course was to create a Rock Paper Scissors text game, in which users type into the console. While I did enjoy making this project, I felt that it would be more interactive and accessible for other users to be able to play this game on a website. 

## The Game Set Up
The game window is divided into two separate sections- one for the user and one for the computer opponent. The emoji that is displayed in the user section will change depending on what button the user selects. 
The choices displayed for the classic game mode are rock, paper, and scissors.
The choices displayed for the bonus mode are rock, paper,scissors, lizards, and spock.
After the emoji is displayed, the computer's selection is randomly assigned and displayed in the computer section.

## Calculating Points
After the computer selection is made, the winner will be calculated and a point will be awarded the user wins. If the computer wins, the user will lose a point.

## Future Goals
I would love to allow for multiple online users to play against each other or create a similar version of this webpage using Flask and my Python code.

## Final Notes
Have fun! Feel free to check out some of my other work:
